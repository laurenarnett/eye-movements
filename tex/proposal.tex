\section{Project Statement} 
\vspace{-0.25cm}
It is estimated that human vision demands anywhere from 30 to 50 \% of brain
processing. As such, optimizing images for processing by the human brain allows
for better information retrieval and retention across the image. Applications
for study of how humans' eyes move across images span from advertising to art.
Being able to predict where humans are most likely to look provides a guideline
as to where to place the most important information, what humans are attracted
to in viewing art, or how an image should be cropped to feature the subject.
Using an existing dataset of eye movements, we are building a predictive model
to generate the most likely fixation locations on a new image.

\section{Methods} 
\vspace{-0.25cm}
We will be using one of two potential datasets of fixation locations. The first
was developed at Osnabr{\"u}ck University. This dataset aggregates 949 images
from multiple studies conducted with different batches of participants over
image categories of natural and urban scenes, web sites, fractal, pink-noise,
and ambiguous artistic figures.  The second was developed specifically for
a similar eye-movement-prediction study by researchers at MIT with data for 15
participants over 1003 natural images from Flickr and LabelMe. While the first
dataset includes a wider variety of images, the second dataset provides data
for many more images per viewer.
